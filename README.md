# Github-Repo-Search
A Github repository search app

## About
This app is the result of my studies using AlamoFire and SwiftyJSON. It is a simple app, only to check how AlamoFire works and how to deal with a JSON returned from the server using SwiftyJSON. You can use the app to search for a repository on Github by name.

## Features
* List all repositories on Github that match the criteria of the search. In this case by the name of the repository.
* Tap in an item of the list will show his details, like the forks count and open issues.
* Search of repositories by more criteria like: by programming language, number of stars, number of followers, etc...(TODO)
